Place realistic GLTF/GLB files here:

- `male.glb` for male model
- `female.glb` for female model

In the app, you can switch via the gender toggle or use the URL param `?gender=female`.

Recommended sources:
- Mixamo (free characters): export as FBX, then convert to GLB via Blender.
- MakeHuman or Ready Player Me (export GLB directly).

After adding `male.glb`, reload the dev server page and the app will switch to the realistic model automatically.
